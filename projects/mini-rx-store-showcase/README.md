## Showcase

Run `npm i`

Run `ng serve mini-rx-store-showcase --open` to see MiniRX in action. 

The showcase is based on the NgRX example from Deborah Kurata: https://github.com/DeborahK/Angular-NgRx-GettingStarted/tree/master/APM-Demo5

I did a refactor from NgRX to MiniRX and the app still works :)

The lib itself lives in [projects/mini-rx-store/src/lib](https://github.com/spierala/mini-rx-store/tree/master/projects/mini-rx-store/src/lib)
