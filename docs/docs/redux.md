The Store represents the Single Source of Truth for the global application state.

## Redux

The Store uses the Redux Pattern to make state management easy and predictable.

The Redux Pattern is based on this 3 key principles:

-   Single Source of Truth
-   State is read-only and is only changed by dispatching Actions
-   Changes are made using pure functions called Reducers
