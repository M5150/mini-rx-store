# MiniRx Store 2 (beta)

### FOR 1.X PLEASE GO TO [THE 1.x BRANCH](https://github.com/spierala/mini-rx-store/tree/1.x)

**MiniRx Store** provides Reactive State Management for Javascript Applications inspired by [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).
It is a global, application-wide solution to manage state and is powered by [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/).


- ðŸ¤“ Learn about it on the [docs site](https://spierala.github.io/mini-rx-store/)
- ðŸš€ See it in action on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/mini-rx-angular-todos?file=src%2Fapp%2Fmodules%2Ftodo%2Fservices%2Ftodos-state.service.ts)

## What's Included
-   RxJS powered global state management
-   State and Actions are exposed as RxJS Observable
-   [Store (Redux API)](https://spierala.github.io/mini-rx-store/docs/redux):
    -   Actions
    -   Reducers
    -   Meta Reducers
    -   Memoized Selectors
    -   Effects
    -   [Support for ts-action](https://spierala.github.io/mini-rx-store/docs/ts-action): Create and consume actions with as little boilerplate as possible
-   [FeatureStore](https://spierala.github.io/mini-rx-store/docs/fs-quick-start): Update state without actions and reducers:
    -   `setState()` update the feature state
    -   `select()` read feature state
    -   `effect()` run side effects like API calls and update feature state
    -   `undo()` easily undo setState actions
-   [Extensions](https://spierala.github.io/mini-rx-store/docs/effects-for-feature-store):
    - Redux Dev Tools Extension: Inspect State with the Redux Dev Tools
    - Immutable Extension: Enforce immutability
    - Undo Extension: Undo dispatched Actions
    - Logger Extension: console.log the current action and updated state
-   Framework agnostic: MiniRx works with any front-end project built with JavaScript or TypeScript (Angular, Svelte, React, Vue, or anything else)
-   TypeScript support: The MiniRx API comes with TypeScript type definitions
-   [Angular Integration](https://spierala.github.io/mini-rx-store/docs/angular): Use MiniRx Store the Angular way: `StoreModule.forRoot()`, `StoreModule.forFeature()`, ...

## Key Concepts
- State is exposed as RxJS Observable
- State has a flat hierarchy and is devided into "features" (also called "slices" in Redux world)
- For each "feature" we can decide to use the **Redux API** with actions and reducers or the **FeatureStore API** with `setState`
- State is read-only and can only be changed by dispatching actions (Redux API) or by using setState (FeatureStore)

## Basic Tutorial
Let's dive into some code to see MiniRx in action

### Store (Redux API)
MiniRx supports the classic Redux API with registering reducers and dispatching Actions.
Observable state can be selected with memoized selectors.

```ts
import { Action, Store, configureStore, createFeatureSelector, createSelector } from "mini-rx-store";
import { Observable } from "rxjs";

// 1.) State interface
interface CounterState {
  count: number;
}

// 2.) Initial state
const counterInitialState: CounterState = {
  count: 1
};

// 3.) Reducer
function counterReducer(
  state: CounterState = counterInitialState,
  action: Action
): CounterState {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "inc":
      return {
        ...state,
        count: state.count + 1
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

// 4.) Get hold of the store instance and register root reducers
const store: Store = configureStore({
  reducers: {
    counter: counterReducer
  }
});

// 5.) Create memoized selectors
const getCounterFeatureState = createFeatureSelector<CounterState>("counter");
const getCount = createSelector(
  getCounterFeatureState,
  state => state.count
);

// 6.) Select state as RxJS Observable
const count$: Observable<number> = store.select(getCount);
count$.subscribe(count => console.log('count:', count));

// 7.) Dispatch an action
store.dispatch({ type: "inc" });

// OUTPUT: count: 1
// OUTPUT: count: 2
```
### Feature Store API
`FeatureStore` allows us to manage feature state without actions and reducers.
The API of a FeatureStore is optimized to select and update a feature state directly with a minimum of boilerplate.

```ts title="counter-feature-store.ts"
import { FeatureStore } from "mini-rx-store";
import { Observable } from "rxjs";

// 1.) State interface
interface CounterState {
  counter: number;
}

// 2.) Initial state
const counterInitialState: CounterState = {
  counter: 11
};

export class CounterFeatureStore extends FeatureStore<CounterState> {

  // Select state as RxJS Observable
  counter$: Observable<number> = this.select(state => state.counter);

  constructor() {
    super('counterFs', counterInitialState)
  }

  // Update state with `setState`
  inc() {
    this.setState(state => ({...state, counter: state.counter + 1}))
  }
}
```

Use the "counterFs" feature store like this:
```ts
import { CounterFeatureStore } from "./counter-feature-store";

const counterFs = new CounterFeatureStore();
counterFs.counter$.subscribe(count => console.log('count:', count));
counterFs.inc();

// OUTPUT: count: 11
// OUTPUT: count: 12
```

**â„¹ The FeatureStore states become part of the global state too.**

Both the Redux feature state and the FeatureStore state are living next to each other in the global state object:

```ts
store.select(state => state).subscribe(console.log);

//OUTPUT: {"counter":{"count":2},"counterFs":{"counter":12}}
```
